Some of the js files are downloaded online such as the isotop.pkgd.min.js, popper.min.js, simple-skillbar.js, and superfish.min.js

The following code I found online to help me make the website better looking

Skill js: It allowed me to use the progress bars in the about me - my education page
Filter js: It allowed me to have the filter search in the projects page
Timeline js: It allowed me to have the scrolling and image fade in feature
Superfish nav menu js: It allowed me to have the arrow button show when hovered over
Header Scroll class js: It allowed me to have the header scroll down when I scroll

I also have another css file called font-awesome that I downloaded online that helped with my font and icons

For the stylesheet.css, there are some classes where I got from w3schools and other resources found online.
